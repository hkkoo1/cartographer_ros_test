# Cartographer ROS Test
This is a cartographer ros performance test, the codes are fetched from https://github.com/googlecartographer/cartographer_ros, thanks for Google's great job to share with us.

###Test Branch###
I will not modify any codes from master branch, while I will do some test, even modify the codes with other branches

#### maseter branch ####
the origin one

#### odom_dev branch ####
the purpose: use odom data + scan data = generate 2d occupancy map, I will use odom data (similar with gmapping with odom data inside tf) and 2d scan data (max range = 10 m) to generate 2d map, here I use:
```
roslaunch cartographer_ros demo_backpack_2d.launch bag_filename:=[bagfile name]
```
you can modify [backpack_2d.lua] with your own setup 

###How to install###
there are 3 main modules in cartographer_ros_test:
```
ceres-solver
cartographer
cartographer_ros
```
Following the instructions from google official cartographer page: [https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]

####for Eclipse usage####
suppose you put cartographer_ros_test into [catkin_ws/src]
```
  cd catkin_ws
  catkin_make_isolated -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"
```

###How to run###
If you do a offline data test, some data bags can be fetched from google offical site,Following the instructions from google official cartographer page: [https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]
